# Hey, I'm Marco.

I'm a software engineer and my interests are *functional programming*, *programming languages implementation* & *web development*.

Right now, I'm:

- Finishing my BSc in **Computer Engineering** @ [UPM](https://www.upm.es)
- Interning as a **Research Assistant** @ [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org).
- Contributing to the [Ciao Lang Project](https://github.com/ciao-lang).
- Continuously learning and building.

<!-- Looking forward to start the MSc in **Formal Methods in Computer Science and Engineering** @ [UCM](https://informatica.ucm.es/master-en-metodos-formales-en-ingenieria-informatica) & [UPM](https://www.fi.upm.es/?id=metodosformalesii). -->
