# Hey, I'm Marco.

I'm a Researcher in Formal Methods in Computer Science, my research interests are *programming languages implementation*, *declarative programming*, *software verification*, *static analysis*, and *type systems*.

Currently, I'm pursuing a **Formal Methods in Computer Science** MSc @ [UCM](https://informatica.ucm.es/master-en-metodos-formales-en-ingenieria-informatica) & [UPM](https://www.fi.upm.es/?id=metodosformalesii). And
I graduated as a Computer Engineer @ [UPM](https://www.fi.upm.es/?id=metodosformalesii).

I've also been working as a research intern for nearly two years @ [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org) contributing to the [Ciao Lang Programming Language](https://github.com/ciao-lang).
