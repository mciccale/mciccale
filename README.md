Howdy!  I'm Marco
=================

I'm a researcher in the field of programming language *theory*, *verification* and *implementation*.
Specifically, my research focuses on the analysis and verification of computer programs using
*abstract interpretation*, a mathematical framework for crafting safe-by-construction, static
program analysis tools.

Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. @ [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org), as one of
the maintainers of the [Ciao](https://ciao-lang.org) programming language and environment, and a member
of the [CLIP Lab](https://cliplab.org) research group.

Useful pointers
---------------

If you want to know more about:

- *Ciao*: you can start by playing around with the [Ciao Playground](https://ciao-lang.org/playground),
  a richly-featured Ciao version compiled to WebAssembly running in the browser. 
- *Abstract interpretation*: these [slides](https://web.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/course/16/16.399/www/lecture_01-intro/Cousot_MIT_2005_Course_01_4-1.pdf)
  of Patrick Cousot's course on abstract interpretation at MIT is a nice starting point!
